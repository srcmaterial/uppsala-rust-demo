<h2 id="arguments"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#arguments">§</a>Arguments</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>env</code> (direction in) - An environment handle returned by #mdb_env_create()</li>
<li><code>path</code> (direction in) - The directory in which the database files reside. This
directory must already exist and be writable.</li>
<li><code>flags</code> (direction in) - Special options for this environment. This parameter
must be set to 0 or by bitwise OR’ing together one or more of the
values described here.
Flags set by mdb_env_set_flags() are also used.</li>
</ul>
 <ul>
	<li>#MDB_FIXEDMAP
 use a fixed address for the mmap region. This flag must be specified
 when creating the environment, and is stored persistently in the environment.
		If successful, the memory map will always reside at the same virtual address
		and pointers used to reference data items in the database will be constant
		across multiple invocations. This option may not always work, depending on
		how the operating system has allocated memory to shared libraries and other uses.
		The feature is highly experimental.
	<li>#MDB_NOSUBDIR
		By default, LMDB creates its environment in a directory whose
		pathname is given in **path,** and creates its data and lock files
		under that directory. With this option, **path** is used as-is for
		the database main data file. The database lock file is the **path**
		with "-lock" appended.
	<li>#MDB_RDONLY
		Open the environment in read-only mode. No write operations will be
		allowed. LMDB will still modify the lock file - except on read-only
		filesystems, where LMDB does not use locks.
	<li>#MDB_WRITEMAP
		Use a writeable memory map unless MDB_RDONLY is set. This uses
		fewer mallocs but loses protection from application bugs
		like wild pointer writes and other bad updates into the database.
		This may be slightly faster for DBs that fit entirely in RAM, but
		is slower for DBs larger than RAM.
		Incompatible with nested transactions.
		Do not mix processes with and without MDB_WRITEMAP on the same
		environment. This can defeat durability (#mdb_env_sync etc).
	<li>#MDB_NOMETASYNC
		Flush system buffers to disk only once per transaction, omit the
		metadata flush. Defer that until the system flushes files to disk,
		or next non-MDB_RDONLY commit or #mdb_env_sync(). This optimization
		maintains database integrity, but a system crash may undo the last
		committed transaction. I.e. it preserves the ACI (atomicity,
		consistency, isolation) but not D (durability) database property.
		This flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().
	<li>#MDB_NOSYNC
		Don't flush system buffers to disk when committing a transaction.
		This optimization means a system crash can corrupt the database or
		lose the last transactions if buffers are not yet flushed to disk.
		The risk is governed by how often the system flushes dirty buffers
		to disk and how often #mdb_env_sync() is called. However, if the
		filesystem preserves write order and the #MDB_WRITEMAP flag is not
		used, transactions exhibit ACI (atomicity, consistency, isolation)
		properties and only lose D (durability). I.e. database integrity
		is maintained, but a system crash may undo the final transactions.
		Note that (#MDB_NOSYNC | #MDB_WRITEMAP) leaves the system with no
		hint for when to write transactions to disk, unless #mdb_env_sync()
		is called. (#MDB_MAPASYNC | #MDB_WRITEMAP) may be preferable.
		This flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().
	<li>#MDB_MAPASYNC
		When using #MDB_WRITEMAP, use asynchronous flushes to disk.
		As with #MDB_NOSYNC, a system crash can then corrupt the
		database or lose the last transactions. Calling #mdb_env_sync()
		ensures on-disk database integrity until next commit.
		This flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().
	<li>#MDB_NOTLS
		Don't use Thread-Local Storage. Tie reader locktable slots to
		#MDB_txn objects instead of to threads. I.e. #mdb_txn_reset() keeps
		the slot reserved for the #MDB_txn object. A thread may use parallel
		read-only transactions. A read-only transaction may span threads if
		the user synchronizes its use. Applications that multiplex many
		user threads over individual OS threads need this option. Such an
		application must also serialize the write transactions in an OS
		thread, since LMDB's write locking is unaware of the user threads.
	<li>#MDB_NOLOCK
		Don't do any locking. If concurrent access is anticipated, the
		caller must manage all concurrency itself. For proper operation
		the caller must enforce single-writer semantics, and must ensure
		that no readers are using old transactions while a writer is
		active. The simplest approach is to use an exclusive lock so that
		no readers may be active at all when a writer begins.
	<li>#MDB_NORDAHEAD
		Turn off readahead. Most operating systems perform readahead on
		read requests by default. This option turns it off if the OS
		supports it. Turning it off may help random read performance
		when the DB is larger than RAM and system RAM is full.
		The option is not implemented on Windows.
	<li>#MDB_NOMEMINIT
		Don't initialize malloc'd memory before writing to unused spaces
		in the data file. By default, memory for pages written to the data
		file is obtained using malloc. While these pages may be reused in
		subsequent transactions, freshly malloc'd pages will be initialized
		to zeroes before use. This avoids persisting leftover data from other
		code (that used the heap and subsequently freed the memory) into the
		data file. Note that many other system libraries may allocate
		and free memory from the heap for arbitrary uses. E.g., stdio may
		use the heap for file I/O buffers. This initialization step has a
		modest performance cost so some applications may want to disable
		it using this flag. This option can be a problem for applications
		which handle sensitive data like passwords, and it makes memory
		checkers like Valgrind noisy. This flag is not needed with #MDB_WRITEMAP,
		which writes directly to the mmap instead of using malloc for pages. The
		initialization is also skipped if #MDB_RESERVE is used; the
		caller is expected to overwrite all of the memory that was
		reserved in that case.
		This flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().
	<li>#MDB_PREVSNAPSHOT
		Open the environment with the previous snapshot rather than the latest
		one. This loses the latest transaction, but may help work around some
		types of corruption. If opened with write access, this must be the
		only process using the environment. This flag is automatically reset
		after a write transaction is successfully committed.
 </ul>
 * `mode` (direction in) - The UNIX permissions to set on created files and semaphores.
 This parameter is ignored on Windows.
 # Returns
<p>A non-zero error value on failure and 0 on success. Some possible
errors are:</p>
 <ul>
	<li>#MDB_VERSION_MISMATCH - the version of the LMDB library doesn't match the
	version that created the database environment.
	<li>#MDB_INVALID - the environment file headers are corrupted.
	<li>ENOENT - the directory specified by the path parameter doesn't exist.
	<li>EACCES - the user didn't have permission to access the environment files.
	<li>EAGAIN - the environment was locked by another process.
